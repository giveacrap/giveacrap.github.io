For the last few months I have gotten into the habit of buying 1 box of La Croix cans at my weekly grocery stop. I live with 3 other people in a small apartment in downtown Portland. Noticing the cans pile up and take precious space in our recycling bin, I decided to take them to the Safeway down the street myself. I like to buy 1 or 2 lottery tickets when I have some extra change and feeling lucky. I thought maybe it'll be worth it to just buy half a ticket with them.... when I can. Get it? can? Anyway, I happen to be fortunate enough to grow up in Oregon. As a youngster we would sometimes collect cans and take them to the store for some extra spending power.

Coming back after not really doing it for 15 years is eye opening to say the least. It's apparent that bottle return is the lowest priority function of Safeway as a business. The room itself is on the opposite end of the building. It is heated, which is nice, but there are always lines going out the door so this results in lines of people waiting in the cold.

Waiting is an understatement. In a downtown you expect things to be a little crowded but businesses are also expected to put extra effort into speedy service. They know that if people don't get things fast they are unlikely to return. After all, they are paying customers. This process seems to break down when the state forces you to provide a service. The lines at the bottle return often take 30 minutes. The machines are exactly the same as I remember them growing up. They jam every 4th customer. Their capacity is fairly small. Safeway requires you to walk over to their customer service desk to notify them of any trouble. The customer service desk sometimes itself has long lines, with employees having to juggle 3 different jobs while dealing with the line.

The employees are always frustrated at the machines and how fickle they are. They will restart it, empty it, jiggle the lock, press buttons two or three times before the computer will register input. Quite frankly, they would probably have an easier time manually crushing cans than fixing these machines.

Even when the machine is up and it's your turn, the machine will still find ways to suck your time. Half of your cans will be rejected. The rejection warning is one word long. Something like: 'UNPROCESSIBLE'. The cans comes back and you are free to try it again and again ad infinitum. It could be a small drop of water scattering the laser. It could be that your beverage does not require a deposit. Sometimes you just need to put them in the other machine to get those last few nickels. In any case, these inefficiencies add up to even more time.

Today, I experienced all but the lines. It was snowing so most people that return cans regularly were hopefully indoors. After returning 23 cans, I came back to the customer service desk to redeem my $1.20 can voucher. By the way, make sure you return that ticket soon. Some employees will refuse to redeem any tickets after the day of return. I found that confusing. The security seals printed on the ticket itself are not enough?

Before leaving home I had also decided to get rid of some extra change that I've accumulated for about 2 years. I counted it at home, put it into separate bags and labelled each one with the dollar amount. I am no stranger to using small change. I know the cashier will have to count it so I thought sorting it out would be a way to make it go quickly. I didn't expect this to work but I wanted to try so I don't have to wait for my bank to open.

Well, surprise, not only did it not work but I got less than zero sympathy from the customer service person. In fact she replied to my request with one angry phrase: "That's what the Coin Star is for!". The first time, I replied: "but they charge 10%!". She simply repeated herself over and over. I told her I would help her count it and they are all sorted but it had no effect. I laughed self defensively and told she didn't need to get upset at me and I understand it's frustrating.

I redeemed my $1.20 bottle ticket and asked for a single Powerball ticket. A Powerball ticket is $2 so I gave her all 7 of the quarters I had to make up the difference. She started counting 4 of them out. I said (and probably shouldn't have) "that's what the Coin Star is for."
But let's get real. If you spent all day asking for change only to have 10% taken off as a fee, how would you feel? I would feel totally ripped off. Especially when my bank will do it for free with a smile on their face.

See what I mean? Bottle returns were not designed to be used exclusively by houseless individuals. It just so happens that they are. So why is Safeway only providing the minimum amount of effort to make the experience worth everyone's time? I mean, it seems like Safeway assumes that all people taking bottles back have nothing better to do. Well, I take my bottles back and I have plenty to do. So does the person behind me. It doesn't matter if they are houseless, struggling with addiction, experiences mental illness or part of a marginalized group. Everyone's time is valuable and everyone deserves some acknowledgement of that. Hopefully it won't be the same way 20 years from today.
